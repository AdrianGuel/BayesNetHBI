Title:Improving Occupants' Quality of Life: A Bayes Network Approach for Modelling Human Behaviours inside Buildings

ABSTRACT
Accurate models of human behaviours inside buildings can improve occupants' quality of life by boosting the awareness of the 
occupant-centric building controls. The literature presents a variety of approaches to solving this problem, but capturing the complexity 
inherent in human interactions remains an open problem. Since we need to capture variable dependencies, handle uncertainty, 
and model the complex interactions between humans and their environment, we propose a model based on a Bayes network (DBN). 
Inspired by the current agent-based models of human-building interactions, we determine the elements of the network and simulate some 
base case scenarios validating its utility. Furthermore, we expose the possibility of including temporal dependencies to determine
the human perception of thermal comfort and modern machine learning tools to improve the human-behaviour model.
